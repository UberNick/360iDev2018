### Why is this important

If we don't learn from our mistakes, we'll repeat them.

### The Fall of the Roman Empire
* Why did it fall?
    * Corrupt Government
    * Rising Christianity
    * Invading Barbarians
    * Arrival of the Huns
    * No More Children
    * The Eastern Empire
    * Hired Mercenaries
    * Logistics Nightmare
    * Economic Troubles
    * Two Major Plagues
    * High Unemployment
    * No Technological Advancement
    * Lead Poisoning
    * ... ROME NEVER FELL?
        * The Byzantine Empire is really a construction. It thought of itself as the Roman Empire. Its people thought of themselves as the Romans.

### What is history?
* "History is an agreed upon fable."

#### The Fall of Microsoft - The Fable of Internet Explorer
* MS didn't care about web standards
* IE was unrelated to Windows
* MS didn't care about the web at all
* MS pushed for proprietary scripting

##### Breaking that down
* "MS didn't care about web standards"
    * Actually, Netscape was the one who began ignoring new standards more and more.
* "IE was unrelated to Windows"
    * Actually it was integrated into the whole OS.
* "MS didn't care about the web at all"
    * Actually their plan had been to connect all their products and services through the internet.

#### Google as Microsoft
* Android as Closed Source
    * Google stopped even trying to develop the Android Open Source project "in public"
    * Googled pushed everything to Play services
    * Google has been replacing the stock apps
    * Antitrust lawsuits

#### The Fall of Jailbreak
* The factors
    * iOS started to feel more complete to users
    * Apple started throwing in the kitchen sink (after Jobs died)
    * Apple decided to prioritize fixing OS bugs
    * the core Jailbreak community left long ago
    * the remaining had a bad sense of humor
    * the developer community had a "death spiral"
* Jailbreak, in hindsight
    * the user community was reliant on teenagers
    * few of the users actually shared the vision
    * Saurik's personal strategy "was, like, non-sensical"
    * likely should not have done r/jailbreak
    * might've maintained more personal space from community (?)

### Culture

The history of humanity is a race between education and catastrophe.

### Failures of Federated Protocols
