### Summary

(Presentation was largely code walkthrough.)

With default collection view layouts, collection views typically present data in a sequential manner. With custom layouts you can lay out items however you want. 

The example used in the talk was a circular scatterplot-type graph. Each dot (or data point) is its own collection view cell, with the layout determining where it's placed onscreen.
