## And All I Got Was This Lousy Shirt

* Session: https://360idev.com/sessions/and-all-i-got-was-this-lousy-shirt/

#### Summary

A 10 year retrospective on Retro Dreamer’s experience with mobile games on iOS and Android since 2008, covering small highs, small lows, big highs, and big lows. What have we done, what went well, what went really well, and what went really badly. Where are we now, and where do we think we are going next. Retro Dreamer have released numerous games to millions of downloads over the last 10 years, occasionally had great success and also some spectacular problems, and somehow we’re still surviving. This talk will try to cover it all.

Making iOS games from 2008

### Being stubborn and loving it

Be stubborn.  Stay frugal in success and failure.  Have supportive partners.

### Sneezies

3 months of work to launch in 2008.  Didn't give up; knew it could be popular.

Got good feedback and didn't give up.

Engaged in market community.  Blogs.  Schwag.  Free lite version.

### Easter Sneezies

In early 2009.  Gave us another price point.

Original game was $2.00 and this was $0.99.  Gave more data.

#### What was working?

Accessible and enjoyable for everyone.  Fun and relaxing.

### Eyegore

Not relaxing in any way and full of gore.

### Elf Commander

A short cheer-up project.  First experience with ads.

Had a few friends using ads and thought they'd try it.  Got a lot of downloads but didn't generate much revenue.

### Moving

Co locating with creative partners is a huge help.  Able to go out as a company to conferences and meet the community.

### DoubleTake

DoubleTake is a memory game, another try at ad support.  Pivoted back to paid right away (few bucks a week vs pennies).

### Sneezies HD for iPad

Premium $5.00 price point, giving more data.  Wasnt able to code it on an iPad because it was made for release.  Helped the original game have a long tail.

### Linkoidz

Another hard arcade puzzle game.  Better art.  Better game.  Theme wasn't ideal.

Gameplay wasn't obvious.  Very unique at the time.  Actually hurt them at the time, but today's features like reviews would have been better because they could see the game in motion.

### Burnout

6-8 months of noting after Linkoidz.  Tried many things, but nothing stuck.  It happens something.

### Velocispider

5-6 weeks of work.  Launched in mid 2011.  It got featured at launch, which was great.

Based on partner's artwork. Seemed like a character they could build a world around.

Boosted by first in-app-purchase (IAP) based on free version.  A break-even project.

### Duckers

Mid 2012.  First free to play title they made.  But took a full year to make because game changed a lot during development.  Much too long.

No plans for post-launch content.

### Happy Poo

Android was getting big and they wanted to get in the world.  So first tried a DoubleTake C++ port (from ObjC), but got no downloads.

Then made Happy Poo after a coupe days of work.  Polished a turd.

Success on Amazon and Google Play.  All you did was swipe the turd until it was shiny.  Then it says "ooh shiny".  Huge on Amazon for some reason.  Will never know why.

Success was funny but didn't feel it would last.  Got half a million downloads, but not sustainable.

Then Happy Poo Jump was a quick game that reused the artwork and just made the thing jump.  Then it became the top source of revenue.

Happy Poo Fall then got released.  After all the success, they ported it and submitted to Apple.  It was rejected.

### Ice Cream

Ice Cream is better than poop.  So they submitted "Ice Cream Jump" using almost same art work.

Multiple games didn't hurt popularity.  Ice Cream jump got ported to Google Play and it worked too.

Poop game got name changed to "pudding" and that was fine on iOS.

Added post-release content and got serious.  Things like hats, new levels, etc.  But still put most effort into making new games.

### Slam Bots

Featured on app store.  Best game they made so far.  Huge flop.  Very few downloads.

A few other games were made.  Started on desktop stuff.  Monsters and Monocles.

### FTC

Had an issue with the FTC.  They'd changed children's data protection laws.  Advertising was no longer allowed to be targeted by device ID.  They ended up being consumed by this legal issue and had a large settlement ($300k).  Didn't make a lot of games or updates during that time.

At a big company, legal deals with it while creative keeps chugging.  When you are creative and still have to do this, it's different.

### Finishing

Finishing a really important skill.  They were good at it at first.  Previous experiences led to some negative reactions to the whole finishing process of submitting and uploading to app store.  Important to get through that and get back to finishing.

**Zombie Free Throw** got released as a fun little project.  Not very successful but good personally.

Not much else to show over 4 years, but did put 90+ updates out.

### Free and Healthy

This year, all the games got their ads removed.  Made most games free now.  Dropped down to 20 iOS apps and 9 Google Play apps (from a peak of 100+, which was nearly impossible to maintain).

Hard to survive in mobile this way, but excitement again about building fun things.
