## Organization For Developers

* Session: https://360idev.com/sessions/unionizing-for-profit-and-fun/

### Author

**Stephen Tramer**

Was a developer until working conditions caused burnout and he transitioned to a full time technical writer

### Why Organize

**Improve working conditions**

Generally working conditions are very good.  But hours are very bad.

Free booze, foosball can be prioritized over things like fairer pay and fairer benefits.

#### Fairer Salaries

Highest salaries of iOS salaries in the country at in Seattle, but cost of living is below San Francisco or Boston.  Boston iOS devs get paid the national average despite higher cost of living.

#### Safer and more stable work environments

How do we get more woman and minorities?  With better protections that are NOT HR-driven.  HR protects the company, not employees.

#### Leverage

Leverage against bosses depends on individual.  But leverage against platforms (like Apple taking 30% of app sales) does not exist.

"Apple kills the app store affiliate program (without announcement), and I have no idea what to do."

#### Community

Building commity

#### Labor

Employers often call our work "passion," but when we clock in, we do it for labor.  We often don't consider our work labor and that's a problem.

Author was fired for working outside of work on open source software.

### Politics

The community does not skew liberal.  It skews libertarian-right.

Organization doesn't have to involve politics.  But politics tries to get involves because companies pay politicians to prevent organization.

### Unionization: Benefits

Requires high level of structure and organization

Best for FTEs, not contractors and indies.

Must be reached by a concensus vote.

AFL-CIO is here to help!  Contact them.

### Unionization: Bad Parts

No guarantee your employer won't just be an "open shop" anyway

Recent Supreme Court decisions are weakening the ability to maintain membership (like to pay strikers)

Their days may be numbered in the USA

### Guilds

Probably what we'll end up with in software.

Best modern examples: SAG-AFTRA, Realtors

Ideal for industries with lots of free agents or frequently change employers.  Like software employers right now.

Guilds set minimum rates for certain types of work.  Meaning standardizing pay.  Also benefits, because they'll come from the union and not employers. And working conditions.

Offer little leverage over specific employers, and require industry-wide adoption.

#### Down sides

Can include members who are not part of the labor force.  

We could join an existing guild like the writers guild.  Or create our own like the brewers guild.  They'll help send info on how to create one.

#### Worker Coalitions

Tend to be focused on individual issues, not necessarily labor.

Often precursor to unionizing or building a guild

Highly political and skew younger.  One example is Google revolted to prevent contracts with military drone manufacturers.

Relies heavily on "irreplaceable" employee participation

Start with Tech Worker's Coalition - they have a slack channel and active branches in SF and Seattle.

Game workers unite is focused on game devs, but they're still devs.
