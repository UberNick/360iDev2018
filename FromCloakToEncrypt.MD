### Story

Two guys walk into a coffee shop.  They wanted to know how they'd be able to use the wifi without worrying about security.

### Goal

Goal of the software was to make the public internet safe.

* For everyone (even mom)
* Clean, attractive, simple
* Works in background

Not worry about competitors and features.  Just public users without hand-holding.

### Launch

Cloak launches in 2011 for iOS (Mac in beta only)

Released in 2013 at MacWorld

100% ObjC and used IPSec, which was clunky in Mac implementation

### Evolution

Cloak began evolving.  

* The flattening! (iOS 7)
* Network Extension (iOS 8)

### Permissions

Apple now warns for permissions before installing a VPN.  And they're not wrong.

"When you use a VPN, your internet usage may be filtered and may be monitored."  This is true, and why it's important to get one that you can trust.  A VPN service with a good, clear privacy policy from a trustworthy company.
