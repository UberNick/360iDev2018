Family unit broken up early.  Sought out other communities to belong, as humans have been doing for millenia.

Made friends not because of common interests, but because of friendship.  Accepting and giving friendship was enough.  Altered appearance and actions to be part of the group, but not just to blend in.

Chameleons change color not just to blend in, but to regulate temperature and feel more comfortable in their surroundings.

Podcast where connections were made on first event, so they kept going.

Invited interesting people, have talked to many.  Common theme is that everyone is terrified to do it.  They put themselves out and never feel good enough, but do it anyway.  Even for experienced people, it doesn't get easier.  Perhaps more comfortable, but talking is always scary.

### Presence is key

When worryabout about how to respond to what's being said, we miss what's being said.  It's important to be **present**.

Tammy would worry about things like the position of her mouth or if her shoes looked okay.  "No one cares about what your shoes look like.  They're too worried about what their shoes look like."

Try to listen.  Ask questions.  "Why are you here?" "What are you trying to get out of it?"
