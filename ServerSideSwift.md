### Reason

Bryan started early with iOS / ObjC before learning a lot of back-end dev stuff.  So it was easy to be blocked when waiting for services to get stood up.

Vapor helps solve that issue by allowing services to be built in a familiar language.

### What's Vapor?

A swift framework to run webapps and API servers.

### Why use Vapor?

Familar language.  Easy to set up.

`brew install vapor/tap/vapor`

`vapor new myProjectName --api`

Note that it can take a minute sometime to build

#### SwiftPM

Vapor uses Swift Package Manager
