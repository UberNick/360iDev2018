### What is Appfigures

Analytics is boring.  You'd much rather actually build and ship your app.

Reporting, tracking, research, ranks, alerts, etc.

Apple doesn't give churn rate for paid apps, so that's a big one.

#### 2010

Just started a year earlier.  They only had a web site, but it was a service for apps.  So they built in app.

Things were a bit different back then.  Apple didn't like that it competed with iTunesConnect and rejected it.  So they opened up the API instead.

Third party apps popped up, used the API, and had their apps released.  For some reason, Apple allowed that.

#### 2013

They bought and acquired one of the third party apps already in production.  Then reskinned it for three months.

Other cofounder (Ariel's brother) rejected it because it was too unintuitive.  So they delayed it a few weeks, past the planned launch of WWDC.

#### 2014

Whole app got thrown away.  Not because it was broken, but because it didn't feel right.  New app was good and solved the UI issues.  Then they shipped it.

### First we tried...

Initial app (never accepted/released), lots of 3rd party clients.

Check for Appfigures by Lemon Labs was the one they got.  But they didn't ship it.  Because it wasn't the app they wanted to give to users.  Some users tested but it was clear it didn't work how they wanted.

### We planned...

They planned.  A lot.  Designed out everything.  Showed all the data.

But **data =/= answers**.

You don't want to use your phone to dig through data.  You don't care to filter by country.  You want questions answered like "is my app making money?"  They want answers, not data.

**filters =/= views**

What are your users asking?  Is that what you're giving to them?

Data isn't data.  Data is used to get to answers.

**lots of paths =/= good**

One path is better.

### Something else

We tried something else.  First by looking at ***what users want*** (or need).

Always Be Curious (ABC) about your users.  Think about their needs.

* What are my users spending time on
* How much of it do they have to spend in my app?
* What's their workflow like
* What questions are they asking?
* What aren't they getting?
* What would they hate?

Our questions are things like "why are my downloads slowing?  Or why did I get a spike in China downloads?"

### Iterate.  A lot!

They iterate a lot.  They had over 100 different **unique** mockups.  Looked at every little thing like deciding between using text for labels vs icons.

One basic core question that informed their final design.  Users either asked directly or hinted at:

\#1 Am I doing better or worse?  

\#2 By how much? (actual number)

### And We Animated

Animate ***all the things***.  Animations are always sexy, but beware of pitfalls.  It has to make sense.

Pitfalls: don't take too long to complete a single animation, and make sure they're **super** smooth.  It can't take away from the experience at all.

Warning: Animating takes a lot of time and iterations to get right.  Think how much you value sleep before jumping in.

### Native

It's all native.  There's no way to do what they did using a framework like React Native.  They wanted to.  They tried.  People ask all the time.

They're not the only ones.  Non-native is great, especially in early stages.  But it's hard, very hard, to get that smooth flow to work right not-native.

### Guest Mode

You can download the app and run it in "demo mode" so you can try it (and not show real data).

### Takeaways

* Need NOT Want

Look at what the users need, not want.  They said they "wanted" to see their data, but really they just needed their questions answered.

* Single path to a solution

* Iterate

There's no real cost to (reasonable) iterating.

* Make it pretty (but also useful)

Pretty without getting in the way.

* Animate if you don't like sleep.
