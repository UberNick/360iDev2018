This is a story about how Cloak went from an Apple only product to being acquired and...

It's not about the software itself.

### Story

Two guys walk into a coffee shop.  They wanted to know how they'd be able to use the wifi without worrying about security.

### Goal

Goal of the software was to make the public internet safe.

* For everyone (even mom)
* Clean, attractive, simple
* Works in background

Not worry about competitors and features.  Just public users without hand-holding.

### Launch

Cloak launches in 2011 for iOS (Mac in beta only)

Released in 2013 at MacWorld

100% ObjC and used IPSec, which was clunky in Mac implementation.  Built with 3 developers!

### Evolution

Cloak began evolving.  

* The flattening! (iOS 7)
* Network Extension (iOS 8)

### Permissions

Apple now warns for permissions before installing a VPN.  And they're not wrong.

"When you use a VPN, your internet usage may be filtered and may be monitored."  This is true, and why it's important to get one that you can trust.  A VPN service with a good, clear privacy policy from a trustworthy company.


### StackPath Acquires Cloak

Grew from a 3-person team to many more, including our speaker.

### Road to Encrypt.me

A year later, they realized the name wouldn't be able to stick.

* Security vs Privacy (look at Cloak's blog)

Their goal is security, not privacy.

* New API

To prepare for the future.  More focus on security.

* Password is now **never** stored

### Encrpyt.me is released

Hiccups with confusing users when switching to new API.  

Transferring apps was also banned for ones that supported in-app purchases.  Until Apple changed that.

### Today

* Team / Family accounts
* Private endpoints
* Self-hosted endpoints in house using Docker images
