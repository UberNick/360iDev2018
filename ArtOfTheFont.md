## Art of the Font

* Session: https://360idev.com/sessions/the-art-of-the-font/

### Author

**Ayal Spitz** from Intrepid, now Accenture Interactive

### Motivation

The way we code hasn't changed a ton.  

Ayal wrote a little mobile IDE so he could code at the airport.  But the coding wasn't the problem, the IDE was.  So he followed the white rabbit.

CoreText was the only way to interact with the text.  It wasn't really doing what he wanted.  So he looked into constructing glphys on his own.  The rabbit hole went deeper.

### Writing

Font is connected to writing.  From Sumerian clay to Chinese clay/block movable type to Gutenburg press.

### Adobe

OpenType, TrueType,

### Apple

Apply Advanced Typography.  Check out Zapfrino.

#### CoreText

Avoid it if you can.  It's a briar patch with a lot of power and a lot of stuff.  Just not the easiest way to get things.  

### Dynamic Type

IB Not compatible with it.  Maybe one day.

We can use BezierPath and exclusion patterns to place text exactly where we want it.  Don't have to worry about positioning or selecting or anything.

### Summary

Don't be afraid of following the white rabbit.  It gives the opportunity to expand horizons, create new things, and hopefully share them.
